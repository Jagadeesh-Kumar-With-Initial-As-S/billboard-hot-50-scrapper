[Sparta Coding Club] BE Week 1 And Solution Of Homework WeekÂ 1
During the BE week one Python was explained.
Here are a few things you should know before diving into learning the Python syntaxâ€¦
Python is a very intuitive language, and there is a lot it can do. However it is difficult for developers to remember all of the syntax of Python. Apart from learning it today, we encourage you to google and find what you need if you ever get stuck!
Some features of the Python language, such as tuples, sets, and classes will not be covered in this basic tutorial. It's okay if you don't know these features for now. However, we encourage you to explore these topics on your own time, as they can become powerful tools in your programming toolbox.

Â ðŸ‘‰ Retrieve the movie title, year, and rating
Â ðŸ‘‰ When you want to get the text inside a tag â†’ tag.text When you want to get an attribute in a tag â†’ tag ['attribute']

import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  
# Read the URL and get the HTML, 
headers = {     'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36' }  
# You will be scraping the data from this page 
url = '<https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250>'  
# Use the requests library to get the HTML code at the url above 
data = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers)  
# The BeautifulSoup library makes it easy to 
# parse HTML code 
soup = BeautifulSoup(data.text, 'html.parser')  
# Using select 
movies = soup.select('.lister > table > tbody > tr')  
# Looping through the movies for movie in movies:     
# First, let's get the title of the movie     
movie_title = movie.select_one('.titleColumn > a').text   
print(movie_title)
Learn the different ways you can use the select method in beautifulsoup

# How to use selector (copy selector) 
soup.select('tag name') 
soup.select('.class name') soup.select('#ID name')  
soup.select('upper tag name > sub tag name> sub tag name') 
soup.select('higher tag name.class name > subtag name.class name')  
# How to find by tag and attribute value 
soup.select('tag name[attribute="value"]')  
# If you only want to bring one 
soup.select_one('same as above')

It's not always accurate, but you can also refer to the Chrome Developer Tools.
